# DonationKit - Reusable Controlled Experiment (RCE)

## About DonationKit RCE
This Reusable Controlled Experiment (RCE) is designed to facilitate the adoption and acceleration of A/B testing for software development teams. 

By leveraging reusable software components equipped with built-in A/B testing capabilities, RCET simplifies the process of conducting controlled experiments, enabling teams to focus on innovation and improvement.

## Features
- Pre-defined Experiment Templates: Jumpstart your experimentation with ready-to-use hypothesis templates and metrics.
- Configurable Software Functionality: Easily adapt the toolkit to suit your specific project needs with configurable parameters and behaviors.
- Integrated Analytics: Built-in support for event logging and integration with popular analytics and A/B testing tools, simplifying data collection and analysis.

## Getting Started
**Installation:** Add it as a git submodule to your project, install using Pods and use it.
**Configuration:** Customize the toolkit to fit your experimentation needs using the initializer function.
**Experimentation:** Start running controlled experiments straight way using Firebase.
